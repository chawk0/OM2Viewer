pollution:
	2 * planet size class (1 - 5) determines the production cap before pollution kicks in
	any production exceeding cap is divided by 2 to produce the pollution penalty
	static production bonuses from things like autofactories (+5) are IGNORED, except
	Robotic Factory!

	basically, once you start polluting, you get half the production-per-worker
	this makes pollution control techs quite nice!

	pollution processor and atmospheric renewer divide the total production value by some
	factor and use that modified amount to compare against the production cap

	pollution processor is /2, atmospheric renewer is /4.  the combination is /8!

	Nano Disassemblers will double the production cap for a planet before pollution kicks in
